# Proto4j (_Prototypes for Java_)

This small Project using the Java language contains different utility modules that provide a specific service. The `Proto4j-ESA` project for instance, can be used to generate embedded shared archives (ESA) that can be loaded and executed during runtime of a Java applications.

### [Proto4j-IconManager](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-iconmgr)

A simple and small Java module that enables quick and easy access to application icons.

### [Proto4j-ESA](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-esa)

Runtime execution of embedded shared archive (ESA) files.

### [Proto4j-Swing](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-swing)

A new way of creating GUIs with Java-Swing. Masks are generated by processing placed annotations.

### [Proto4j-dx](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-dx/tree/master)

A module for working with the Android-dx tool. All actions and classes can be created by using an instance of the DexFactory. Releases published on this repository will be named according to the used Android-dx tool version. With this small library you can create Dex-files and read/import them.

### [Proto4j-Redis](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-redis)

A type-safe framework to turn a java interface into a database worker. SQLFactory implementation modules are provided in the factories directory of the repository. Currently, only SQLite and MySQL are provided.

### [Proto4j-XTral](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-xtral)

A framework for creating thead-safe oriented client and server structures in Java. The communication can be built on single and/or multicast connections; the receiving and writing process has to be be declared. 

### [Proto4j-JBracket](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-jbracket)

A small and simple Java-Swing component to display tournament brackets in a two-dimensional grid, whereby each column can store a different amount of cells. 

### [Proto4j-Objection](https://github.com/Proto4j/proto4j-objection)

Java-API used to de-/serialize Objects from/into a binary format. There are two possibilities on how to write code that will be serializable by this module:

* Use standard Java directives
* Use pre-defined Annotations on declared classes and fields. further This small overview tries to show both versions as detailed as possible. Nested serializable types will be automatically detected.
